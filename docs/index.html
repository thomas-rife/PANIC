        <p>
          As college students, time is always in short supply. Traditional
          programming languages require complex syntax and deep familiarity with
          detailed documentation, which can slow you down when you’re racing
          against a deadline. The PANIC programming language was designed with
          this in mind, offering a streamlined, efficient approach that cuts the
          complexity so you can write, debug, and run your programs quickly,
          even if you only have a quick minute to get it done.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          PANIC achieves this efficiency by blending shorthand abbreviations
          with the option to use full descriptive commands. This approach allows
          users to choose a more concise, rapid coding style when speed is
          essential, or a more traditional format when clarity and readability
          are more important. PANIC's flexible keywords and simple notation
          reduce the risk of small syntax errors preventing your program from
          running smoothy the first time. This also makes debugging faster, more
          intuitive and much easier to understand.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Ultimately, PANIC is more than just another coding language, it’s a
          practical tool for modern software challenges. Whether you’re tackling
          an urgent assignment or experimenting with new ideas, PANIC provides a
          flexible, high-performance environment that allows you to focus on
          scripting efficiently rather than fighting with a language's verbose
          syntax. This makes it an ideal choice for both the procrastinating
          student and the experienced developer seeking a fresh approach to
          development.

          In PANIC function declarations need to have explicitly typed
          parameters. In addition, if, else, and elif statements are very
          Pythonic, however, they don't need to end with colons. Variable
          assignments follow the form
          <code>name: literal</code>. This is because we use the equals sign to
          test for equality. Because the function returns void the return type
          does not need to explicitly be marked, similar to Swift.

          In PANIC <code>l</code> stands for loop and it is used both for whiles
          and for loops. We use the <code>...</code> for shorthand notation to
          make ranges. Ranges start from the first number and include the last
          number, but don't go above it.
