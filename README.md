## Introduction

As college students, we don't have a ton of time to complete every assignment. Some of the languages we use require complex syntax and deep knowledge of documentation. When trying to complete something quickly, it's difficult to finish when simple spelling errors or syntax errors are preventing you from turning in your assignment. PANIC is meant to be a quick, fast, and efficient language so that if you have waited until the last minute to complete a coding assignment, you can quickly write, debug, and run so that you finish on time. The shorthand abbreviations combined with the full words allow users to be as verbose as they want, while simultaneously allowing them to script very efficiently.

## List of Features

- We wanted to target students, and people who want to focus on programming and not syntactic sugar that many languages like to use. There are very shorthand, single-letter ways to write common statements, including declaring functions as `f`, return being `r`, and so on.
- We wanted the language to focus on scripting speed above all, abbreviations and easy shortcuts are going to make this language quick to write and fast to debug.
- We took inspiration from Python's use of indentation to avoid the use of brackets, something we find to be unnecessary. While we do encourage the use of shorthand notation, we will also allow multiple spellings of each keyword, such as p and print both functioning the same. If you scripted something in the shorthand notation and wanted to publish it to make it more readable, you could expand out your keywords and it would function the same.
- We took several aspects of other languages that we liked and incorporated their ideas into our language, for example we loved how Swift handled range in loops and wanted to do so something similar. We settled on the `...` operator to show the range of a loop. Also, we tried to avoid other common practices which to us didn't make sense, such as the `==` sign.
- Strong statically typed language, very similar to Swift's type system.
- Keyword and positional arguments as well as rest parameters.
- First-class functions with support for functional programming, both function composition and pipelining written with either a left or right arrow.
- Easy way to create ranges using ranges as well as easy array slicing to preserve immutability.

## Example Programs

### Example 0: Hello World

Starting out simple, printing is very easy in PANIC, simply write print or p. Furthermore, one can either use parenthesis or not for function calls.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
p("Hello, World!") # Print a message

```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 1: Comparison function

In PANIC, function declarations have explicitly typed parameters. The
conditional statements (if, elif, else) resemble Python but without
requiring colons, and variable assignments use the form
`name: literal` (since the equals sign is used for equality
tests).

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
f compare_numbers(x int y int){  # Function Definition
  if x = y {
    pl (x "is equal to" y)
  }
  elif x < y {
    pl (x "is less than" y)
  }
  else {
    pl (x "is greater than" y)
  }
}

im n1: 10 # variable assignment
im n2: 20
compare_numbers(n1 n2)  # Call the function
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
function compareNumbers(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    console.log(a + " is equal to " + b);
  } else if (a < b) {
    console.log(a + " is less than " + b);
  } else {
    console.log(a + " is greater than " + b);
  }
}

let n1 = 10;
let n2 = 20;
compareNumbers(n1, n2);
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 2: Fibonacci

In PANIC, `l` stands for loop, which is used for both for
and while loops. Mutable variables are denoted as `mu` and
immutable ones are denoted as `im`. Ranges are written using
`...`, which includes the starting and ending numbers.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
f fibonacci(n int){
  mu x: 0  # Initialize starting values
  mu y: 1
  l i in [0...n]{  # Loop from 0 to n
    p(x " ")
    mu z: x
    x : y
    y: z + x
  }
  r # return
}
im num_terms: 10
fibonacci(num_terms)
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  let a = 0,
    b = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(a);
    let next = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = next;
  }
}

let numTerms = 10;
fibonacci(numTerms);
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 3: Factorials with tail recursion

In PANIC, you must declare a return type for the function. Also,
logical operators like `or` are spelled out instead of
using `||`.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
f factorial(n int) -> int {
  if n = 0 or n = 1 {
    r 1
  }
  r n*factorial(n-1)
}
p(factorial(5))
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 4: Recursive looping

In PANIC, arguments to a function can either be positional or keyword. Positional arguments come first, then keyword args, and `...` is used to collect the rest of the arguments into an array.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
l i in [1...5]{
	l j in i {
	    p("*")
	}
	p(" ")
}
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  let row = "";
  for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
    row += "* ";
  }
  console.log(row);
}
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 5: Arrays

This is how arrays are done in PANIC compared to JavaScript. The arrays all have types and they are all checked.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
# Create immutable array ranging from 1 to 20, each multiplied by 2
im x: [1...20, *2]

# Create a nested array structure
im y: [[[x]]]

# Access the first element of the nested array
mu z: y[0][0][0]

# Modify the value of z to a new array
z: [1 2 3 4 5]
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
const x = Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, i) => (i + 1) * 2);

const y = [[[x]]];

let z = y[0][0][0];

z = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

</td>
</table>
### Example 6: Classes

This is how classes are done in PANIC compared to JavaScript. Classes are defined using `c` with constructors being defined using `con`. Objects can be created as immutable or mutable.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
# Define a class Dog
c Dog {
  # Define constructor
  con(name string)
    f bark(sound string) -> string {
        im greet: name + " says " + sound
        return greet
    }
}

# Create a new Dog
im dog: Dog("rocky")

dog.bark("woof")
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  bark(sound) {
    const greet = this.name + " says " + sound;
    return greet;
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("rocky");
console.log(dog.bark("woof"));
```

</td>
</table>

### Example 7: Anonymous Functions, Range and Maps

This is an example of functional programming and first-class functions in our language. In our language, the arrows show the flow of data, which can be written both ways. Despite the way it is written the function composition will still be the same: in this case `p(d(b))`.

<table>
<tr> <th>PANIC</th><th>JS</th><tr>
</tr>
<td>

```PANIC
d int: int x r x + 1
b: [1...7, +2]
b -> d -> p     # or p <- d <- b
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
d = (x) => x + 1;
b = [1, 3, 5, 7];
x = b.map(d);
console.log(x);
```

</td>
</table>

## List of Semantic Checks

- Functions, variables and classes must have unique names
- Parameters must have different names
- Function calls must have correct number of arguments
- Function arguments must be the same type as expected parameter types
- Class stuff HERE
- For loops must be over items that are iterable
