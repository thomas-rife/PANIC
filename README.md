## Language Name: CODING WITH BRIAN
## Introduction
## List of Features
- Do you have a specific audience in mind? Artists? Graphic designers? AI researchers? Numeric and Scientific nerds? Natural language types? Game developers? Machine learning people? Animators? High performance folks? System programmers? Or do you want a general purpose language? Or do you just want to do what you want?
- Understand the audience that the language is designed for, and what kinds of things they want to create with it (or problems they want to solve with it).
- Determine if your language is to be (1) a reasonable, usable language or (2) an esoteric/joke/golfing language.
- Determine if it is to be pragmatic, idealistic, researchy, or evil.
- Determine whether you want your language firmly in one camp—OO, functional, logic, concatenative, plain-imperative—or be a multiparadigm symphony. Or a multiparadigm cacophony.
- Determine whether it is to be built on a single characteristic building block (a crystallization of style) or one with a huge variety of syntactic forms for multiple semantic aspects (an agglutination of features).
- Determine your concurrency model. Do you want all your programs to be single-threaded and sequential? Or are you looking for something event-driven and async? Or multithreaded? Or distributed?
